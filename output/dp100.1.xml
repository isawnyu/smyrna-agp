                    <lb/>on the east face of pier a100, incised. dimensions 22.5 cm wide × 25 cm high.
                    <lb/>Graffito of a ship sailing on port tack, possibly a liburna, located on the eastern face of pier a100. The graffito is partially damaged by a large gap in the plaster that has destroyed the ship’s stern and the left half of the sail. The ship is characterized by a large central mast, which is cov- ered in a motif of crisscrossing lines identifying the rigging. a set of vertical lines, also meant to represent the rigging as well as the sail’s brailing ropes, departs from the yard and reaches the ship’s deck, defining a large trapezoidal sail. above the yard, a series of diagonal lines departing from the central mast (considerably narrower than the portion visible below the yard and ter- minating in a very stylized καρχήσιον) are part of the κηροῦχοι. The keel is flat, and the prow is slightly rounded. above the gunwale is a lattice motif representing the boat’s sidescreen, sug- gesting that the liburna was of the cataphract type. The prow terminates with a short triangular στόλος with no ἀκροστόλιον above it. from the keel projects an exaggerated ἔμβολος, in the shape of a stylized penis, with a diagonal line on the tip identifying the epithelium, confirming that the vessel has to be interpreted as a navis rostrata.</support>
