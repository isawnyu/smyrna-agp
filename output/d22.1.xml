                    <lb/>In the western half of the bay, in black ink. dimensions 13.5 cm wide × 15.5 cm high.
                    <lb/>dipinto of a human bust, located in the western half of the back wall of Bay 22, toward the middle. The head, possibly of a female, is drawn in profile toward the left, and the bust is cut short right below the shoulders. The figure has an up hairdo consistent with late second century fashion: in the front the hair is wavy and descends to cover the forehead, while at the back the hairs are gathered together in a bun fastened with a fillet. The woman in the graffito is depicted with a rather long, “roman” nose, thick and protruding lips, and round and prominent chin. The large, almond-shaped eye, positioned near the hair line, is completed with eyelashes and a pupil which is turned to look directly at the viewer.
                    <lb/>similar hairstyles are attested on portraits of faustina the younger, like the one at Musei capi- tolini in rome dated to 147–148, or of Bruttia crispina, like the head at the altes Museum, Ber- lin, dated to 178–180. Basic information on portraits of these two roman queens can be found in Kleiner 1992: 277–80.</support>
