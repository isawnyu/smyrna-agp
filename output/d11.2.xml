                    <lb/>In the upper right quadrant of the bay, in black ink. dimensions 16 cm wide × 18 cm high.
                    <lb/>dipinto of a gladiator holding the palm of victory, located in the upper right quadrant of the back wall of Bay 11. due to the lack of any helmet or shield and the presence of a subligaculum it is possible to recognize in the figure a retiarus. The lines on the left arm suggest the presence of a manica (arm-guard), while the plate across his back is a galerus, a tall metal guard protect- ing the shoulder. The very faded lines that descend from the right shoulder of the gladiator reaching down toward the ground could represent what is preserved of the net. The gladiator is depicted as striding forward toward the left, with the groundline below his feet defined by several thick streaks. The man has his back to the viewer and the face in profile, the chin and nose accentuated and the hair rendered in flowing curls.</support>
