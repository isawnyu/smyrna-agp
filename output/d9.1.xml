                    <lb/>In the upper right quadrant of the bay, in black ink. dimensions 17 cm wide × 39 cm high.
                    <lb/>dipinto of a human figure, possibly a gladiator, located in the upper right quadrant of the back wall of Bay 9. The depiction of this human figure is quite difficult to interpret, both for its sum- mary execution and for the fading black color. from the extant traces it seems possible to rec- ognize in the man a murmillo, shown in three-quarter and in the act of advancing toward the right, with his right leg partially raised and advanced. The identification is based on the large
                    <lb/>size of his upper torso, the tight loincloth (subligaculum) revealing the contours of the buttocks, and the lines at his waist indicating a balteus. a helmet with a stylized element on top (a poorly rendered crest and fish?) protects his head, while at his left, partially covered by the body, is visible the outline of a long shield, possibly a scutum. The man’s left leg is visibly larger than the right one, and it is drawn in a thicker line, suggesting the presence of a greave, a customary accessory for a murmillo.
                    <lb/>similar pose and attributes can be found in one graffito from the theater of aphrodisias (lang- ner 2001: no. 761, dated to late antiquity) and another one from the paedagogium of the domus tiberiana (solin and Itkonen-Kaila, eds. 1966: no. 97, p. 133).</support>
