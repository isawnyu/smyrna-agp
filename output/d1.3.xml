                    <lb/>In the upper right quadrant of Bay 1, in red and black ink. dimensions 20 cm wide × 27 cm high.
                    <lb/>dipinto of a male bust located at the upper right quadrant of the back wall of Bay 1. The draw- ing is mostly made in red ink. Black strokes, visible in the dipinto’s lower half, could have served as preparatory guidelines. The head and shoulders are fully frontal. The man wears a short hairstyle, with slightly wavy hair falling on the forehead. he has a long, full, and wavy beard that starts from below his pointed ears and terminates, at the center of the chin, in a pointed tip. Thin mustaches are visible above the upper lip. The mouth is small and the lips are thin. The nose is straight and the large eyes, with marked pupils, are asymmetrical and almond- shaped. The eyebrows are linear and heavily marked in red. The large neck is visibly elongated, with a central long line suggesting its fullness. at its base, a simple line indicates the tunic’s rounded rim.</support>
