                    <lb/>In the center, upper register, of the bay, in black ink. dimensions 8 cm wide × 10 cm high.
                    <lb/>dipinto of a male head, located at the top of the back wall of Bay 29, toward the middle. The head is shown in profile, turned toward the left. The proportions and the poor detailing suggest that the drawing was not made by a trained artist. The head is characterized by a large almond- shaped eye with a round pupil and short eyebrow. The sharp acute line of the nose begins at the eye’s left corner. The upper lip is quite pronounced and the mouth is drawn as open. Below the undershot chin is a large, elongated neck. The hairline begins right above the eye, with no space left for the forehead. The hairdo is rendered in a few, thick parallel lines that follow the skull’s curvature, suggesting that the straight hair touched the nape of the neck. The ear is long and tear-shaped. The man might be a spectator, cf. T29.8</support>
