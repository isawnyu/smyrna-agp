                    <lb/>dipinto of a bird, located in the lower right quadrant of the back wall of Bay 25. The bird, pos- sibly a dove, is drawn in thick black lines in profile, turned toward the right. It has a pointed beak, short crown, and a long and sinuous neck. The right, leaf-shaped wing is prominently displayed and constitutes the lower outline of the figure. a line runs at its center, schematically suggesting the feathers’ orientation. The tail feathers are barely indicated by two thicker lines. The bird has a very elongated and thin thigh, which terminates in a large triangle-shaped claw.</support>
