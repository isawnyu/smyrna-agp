                <ab>This is the beginning of a riddle, of which whatever else was written is now lost under the new layer of plaster applied just below it (cf. T8.1). It is possible also that nothing more was written. cf. T28.1. ἀπόλωλε is a possible interpretation, but the apparent iota in the last circle is puzzling. as it stands at the extreme left of the available space inside the circle, perhaps nu was intended or written but now mostly lost. we do not know why the letters are written inside circles. on the bevel of the right pier are some scattered letters.</ab>
