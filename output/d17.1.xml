                    <lb/>In the center of the bay, in black and red ink. dimensions 167 cm wide × 120 cm high.
                    <lb/>very long dipinto in thick black and red lines, located at the center of the back wall of Bay 17. The shape, narrow and elongated, tapers at the two ends. a packed series of parallel straight lines are drawn within the form’s outline. a long line, parallel to the lower margin, runs throughout the whole width. other lines seem to have continued below the main outline, but they are now completely faded. The dipinto can be interpreted as a ship: two very faded lines at the center identify the tapering shape of a mast, decorated with two horizontal lines defining the ropes tied around it. This suggests that the upper portion of the drawing has to be understood as a furled sail. The bulwark and the keel are completely faded.</support>
