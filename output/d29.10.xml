                    <lb/>In the upper left quadrant of the bay, in black ink. dimensions 23 cm wide × 21.5 cm high.
                    <lb/>dipinto of a bird, located in the upper left quadrant of the back wall of Bay 29. This graffito overlaps parts of graffito D29.1, suggesting that it was drawn at a later date (though it is impos- sible to determine any specific time lapse between the first and the second graffito). The bird is in profile and turned toward the right. possibly a dove, it has an elongated and pointed beak, a tall and round crown, and a rather large neck. The leaf-shaped right wing is located at the cen- ter of the body, its bottom characterized by a zig-zag motif that simulates the bird’s primaries. The tail is long and the round breast is clearly visible below the wing. one of the thighs, drawn diagonally, is well marked in thick lines, whereas the second one, possibly crossing the first one, is for the most part faded. The claw is drawn in foreshortening.</support>
